		In computer science we're typically tasked with solving the problem of <i>reducing entropy</i>.  We study memory allocation, code optimization, data structures, etc to reduce time or space complexity.  
		<br><br>
		While ostensibly it's more useful to invest time in making sense and order out of randomness, the consistent and accurate generation of random numbers holds an underrated importance in future software applications and is the subject of this project.

		<p>Less Information</p>
		Intuitively, one can understand that nothing is truly random.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, think of the traditional random event -- flipping a coin.  If we know all of the variables involved in flipping the coin (the mass of the coin, the force, the angle of force, the wind resistance, etc), we could calculate the outcome of the coinflip with complete accuracy.
		 
		<br><br>
		Modern day randomness is defined as an event that "lacks predictability".<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather, which was largely regarded as random, has been "figured out" and is now forecasted weeks in advance.  History testifies to the fact that as technology progresses, our tools will allow us to decipher patterns that were once regarded as random or implausibly complex.

		<br><br>
		I'm a computer scientist specializing in Cyber Security and Cryptography.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptographic integrity is directly related to our ability to generate a complex pattern.  The basis of modern technological security is creating a code which is considered infeasible to decipher, which directly results in the confidence and use-ability of any website, webservice, or e-product.  <br>

		This project is a statistical analysis of the pseudo-random number generators within various popular programming languages.
