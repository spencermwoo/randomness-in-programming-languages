                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my computer science career, I'm typically tasked with solving the problem of <i>reducing entropy</i>.  
        
        <br></br><br></br>
        
        We've all learnt about memory allocation, code optimization, various data structures -- all for the purpose of reducing time complexity.  While ostensibly it is more useful to invest time to make sense of random data, the consistent and accurate generation of random numbers holds an equal importance in today's applications and is the subject of this project: <i>generating entropy</i>.
      
        <br></br><br></br>

        <h4>Randomness</h4>
      
        Intuitively, one can understand that nothing is truly random.

        <br></br><br></br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, consider the traditional random event of flipping a coin.  The odds of each outcome is evenly likely: both at fifty percent.  However if we were to uncover all of the variables involved in flipping the coin (the mass of the coin, the force, the angle of force, the wind resistance, etc), we could calculate the exact outcome of the coinflip with complete accuracy.  Randomness exists solely as a theoretical concept.
      
        <br></br><br></br>
      
        The word "random" is more accurately defined as an event which <i>"lacks predictability"</i>.
        
        <br></br><br></br>
        
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weather - once largely considered random and controlled by the Gods - has been "figured out" and is now forecasted weeks in advance on the local news stations.  History testifies that as technology progresses, our tools allow us to decipher patterns that were once regarded as implausibly complex.  Understanding the world and unraveling all wonder is framed as a net-positive for humanity however . . .

        <h4>Cryptography</h4>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptographic integrity is directly related to our ability to generate complex patterns.  The basis of modern technological security is creating math codes which are infeasible to decipher in a modern timeframe.  This strong entropy in asymmetric cryptography directly results in the confidence and use-ability of all modern important technologies: any website, webservice, or e-product.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What value is a lock that opens with any combination or key?
